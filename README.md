# Heat Dissipation Simulation in a Data Center or Device
This Python project models the heat dissipation in a data center or device using basic thermal equations. The simulation takes into account factors such as CPU usage, fan speeds, and ambient temperature to estimate how the CPU's temperature evolves over time.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet informative demonstration of heat transfer in electronic systems, with a focus on real-time heat generation and dissipation. It also serves as an introduction to thermal modeling and simulation for data centers or electronic devices.
##Problem Overview
Data centers and electronic devices generate heat while running, especially when the CPU is under heavy load. Proper thermal management is crucial to ensure that the device operates efficiently without overheating. This simulation models heat dissipation by balancing the heat generated by the CPU and the cooling provided by fans, while accounting for ambient temperature.

This project allows you to simulate and visualize how CPU temperature fluctuates based on:

 - CPU Usage
 - Fan Speeds
 - Ambient Temperature

It uses basic thermal equations to simulate heat generation and dissipation over time and provides a visual output in the form of a graph.
